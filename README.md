Integration of Node2Vec with PyTorch:
Node embeddings generated by Node2Vec can serve as input features to a neural network.
Converting embeddings to PyTorch tensors is essential for compatibility.
Defining a Neural Network:
Inherits from nn.Module to leverage PyTorch's functionalities.
Layers (nn.Linear) and activation functions (nn.ReLU) are defined in the constructor.
The forward method defines how data flows through the network.
Training the Model:
Loss Function: Measures the discrepancy between predictions and true labels.
Optimizer: Updates model parameters to minimize the loss.
Training Loop: Iteratively updates the model based on the loss, improving its performance over time.
Practical Considerations:
Batching: For large datasets, it's common to process data in batches to manage memory and improve training efficiency.
Evaluation Metrics: Beyond loss, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc., are used to evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Parameters like learning rate, number of epochs, hidden layer size, etc., can be adjusted for optimal performance.
